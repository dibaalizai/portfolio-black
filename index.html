									<h2><a href="#"><br />	From 36,000ft</a></h2>
									
									<p>
										Imagine this, you get to work in one of the best airlines in the world. You can call  A380 and Boeing 777 your office. You  get to live in a city like Dubai featuring multi-faceted architectures such as Burj Khalifa, the Palm Islands,and Burj Al Arab. You get to see so many places in the world that you didn’t even know existed. And you get paid to do it. That was my job. My job was spent at 36,000 feet, way up past the clouds. I met some of the most fantastic people and traveled to wherever my heart desired. Yet, I always knew, this was not it for me. I wanted to create, build, teach, learn. But where was I going? What was I going to do? </p>

										<h2><a href="#"><br />	Flight Attendant Dreams</a></h2>
										<p>	I started as a flight attendant back in June of 2013. It was my dream job for years, but that itch to learn something new, create something beautiful, teach someone else was always there. And while the idea of moving on was hard to grasp, I was zealous in finding my next calling in life. I found it when I stumbled upon a coding bootcamp in 2015. They claimed, “Change careers, learn new skills, become a web developer.” Hmm, let’s see what the fuss is all about.</p>


										<h2><a href="#"><br />	Online Studying</a></h2>
										<p> For years I struggled with the idea of leaving my job as a flight attendant. After months of going back and forth, I finally decided I needed to take that leap of faith. I started to attend online seminars and took several online courses to understand whether this is the right field for me. I read books, installed programs on my computer, and watched video tutorials. It should go without saying that before making any big commitment I made sure it’s a good fit for me.	</p>

										<h2><a href="#"><br />	Coding Bootcamp</a></h2>
										<p> I started my bootcamp in March 2022. Was this going to be worth it? Would I spend all this money and be able to get a job afterwards?	I attended CodeGorilla, a coding bootcamp located in Groningen,  the beautiful city in the North of the Netherlands. My program was 4 months long. The first month was called baseCamp where basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript were taught. In the remaining three months we focused on PHP, OOP, Node.js, Git/Github, MySQL, Laravel and  a little bit of Angular. This stack left me overwhelmed. After every long 10 hour day, I’d return to sleep, my mind spinning, only to wake up and start it all over again. Had I made the right choice? We built two projects. One was a personal project where I built a static website. It was my first project, it was my own, I was ecstatic! My second project was a group project where we created a web app. This project used a database. Whilst working in a team I learned to collaborate on projects on Github. While the bootcamp was overwhelming on a daily basis, it was very reassuring that I was making real projects. I was building, I was creating, this was fun!</p>

										<p>Let’s not be afraid to clarify that practising coding is more important than education. </p>
